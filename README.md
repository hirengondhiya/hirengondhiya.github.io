## Description
- ### Purpose
    The purpose of my portfolio website is to practice and to show my professional web development, Project Planning, & execution skills to the world using a simple and clean website. 
    
    Through this website I am also hoping to get in contact with perspective employers for employment opportunities and with like minded developers for collaboration on open source projects.

- ### Wireframes
    
    Before getting started with developing the web site wireframes were built to plan different kind of pages that I need to build to serve above purpose and to visulise how they should look like on small screen and large screen devices.

    I have come with following wireframes.
